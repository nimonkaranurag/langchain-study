### About This Repository
    
This repository is a comprehensive study resource for learning **LangChain** through practical examples.
It contains three production-ready AI assistants and extensive learning notes:
    
- **🔍 Search Assistant**: A ReAct search agent with structured outputs
- **👔 HR Assistant**: Company policy expert with time-off request capabilities  
- **📚 Study Assistant**: Interactive guide for LangChain concepts and this repo
    
Built with LangChain, LangSmith tracing, vector databases (Pinecone), and multiple LLM providers.

*I had built this repo as a consequence of my need to learn LangChain for my role as an AI Engineer at IBM, Dublin.*

For contributions, I recommend understanding the implementation of the different assistants through the abstractions provided.
