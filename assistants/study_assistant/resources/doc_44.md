### Product naming changes: LangSmith Deployment and LangSmith Studio

General

Published October 17, 2025

We’ve updated product names across the LangSmith UI, docs, and website to make it clearer how our tools fit together.

What changed?

* LangGraph Platform is now LangSmith Deployment
* LangGraph Studio is now LangSmith Studio
* LangSmith has 3 services: LangSmith Observability, LangSmith Evaluation, and LangSmith Deployment

You’ll see these new names reflected everywhere — including in the in-product navigation, website (<https://langchain.com/>), and documentation (<https://docs.langchain.com/>).

Why we made this change
As our platform evolves, we want our naming to better reflect what each product does and how they work together:

* LangSmith Deployment (formerly LangGraph Platform) provides purpose-built infrastructure for deploying and managing long-running agent workloads.
* LangSmith Studio (formerly LangGraph Studio) provides an interactive IDE for debugging and improving your agents. Users of LangSmith Deployment on all plan types will have access to LangSmith Studio

These updates make it easier to understand the relationship between LangSmith’s observability, evaluation, and deployment capabilities.

* LangSmith Observability: Complete visibility into agent behavior with tracing, real-time monitoring, alerting, and high-level insights into usage.
* LangSmith Evaluation: Run evals before and after shipping, gather expert feedback on real performance, and iterate on prompts with your team.
* LangSmith Deployment: Purpose-built infrastructure for deploying and managing long-running agent workloads.

What’s not changing

* Anything related to security
* All existing deployments, APIs, and workflows continue to work as they do today.
* No updates are needed on your end — this is a naming change only.
* Pricing, configurations, and contracts remain exactly the same.
  + Users do not need to use LangSmith Observability or Evaluation to use Deployment
