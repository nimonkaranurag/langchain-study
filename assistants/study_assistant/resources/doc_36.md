# LangSmith docs

**LangSmith provides tools for developing, debugging, and deploying LLM applications.** It helps you trace requests, evaluate outputs, test prompts, and manage deployments in one place. LangSmith is framework agnostic, so you can use it with or without LangChain’s open-source libraries [`langchain`](/oss/python/langchain/overview) and [`langgraph`](/oss/python/langgraph/overview). Prototype locally, then move to production with integrated monitoring and evaluation to build more reliable AI systems.

LangGraph Platform is now [LangSmith Deployment](/langsmith/deployments). For more information, check out the [Changelog](https://changelog.langchain.com/announcements/product-naming-changes-langsmith-deployment-and-langsmith-studio).

## [​](#get-started) Get started

Create an account

Sign up at [smith.langchain.com](https://smith.langchain.com) (no credit card required). You can log in with **Google**, **GitHub**, or **email**.

Create an API key

Go to your [Settings page](https://smith.langchain.com/settings) → **API Keys** → **Create API Key**. Copy the key and save it securely.

Once your account and API key are ready, choose a quickstart to begin building with LangSmith:

[## Observability

Gain visibility into every step your application takes to debug faster and improve reliability.](/langsmith/observability-quickstart)[## Evaluation

Measure and track quality over time to ensure your AI applications are consistent and trustworthy.](/langsmith/evaluation-quickstart)[## Deployment

Deploy your agents as Agent Servers, ready to scale in production.](/langsmith/deployments)[## Platform setup

Use LangSmith in managed cloud, in a self-hosted environment, or hybrid to match your infrastructure and compliance needs.](/langsmith/platform-setup)[## Prompt Testing

Iterate on prompts with built-in versioning and collaboration to ship improvements faster.](/langsmith/prompt-engineering-quickstart)[## Studio

Use a visual interface to design, test, and refine applications end-to-end.](/langsmith/quick-start-studio)

LangSmith meets the highest standards of data security and privacy with HIPAA, SOC 2 Type 2, and GDPR compliance. For more information, see the [Trust Center](https://trust.langchain.com/).

## [​](#workflow) Workflow

LangSmith combines observability, evaluation, deployment, and platform setup in one integrated workflow—from local development to production.
