## How Does It Work?

#### Data Sourcing

Beam reads your data from a diverse set of supported sources, no matter if it’s on-prem or in the cloud.

#### Data Processing

Beam executes your business logic for both batch and streaming use cases.

#### Data Writing

Beam writes the results of your data processing logic to the most popular data sinks in the industry.

## Apache Beam Features

##### Unified

A simplified, single programming model for both batch and streaming use cases for every member of your data and application teams.

##### Extensible

Apache Beam is extensible, with projects such as TensorFlow Extended and Apache Hop built on top of Apache Beam.

##### Portable

Execute pipelines on multiple execution environments (runners), providing flexibility and avoiding lock-in.

##### Open Source

Open, community-based development and support to help evolve your application and meet the needs of your specific use cases.

Write Once, Run Anywhere

Create Multi-language Pipelines
