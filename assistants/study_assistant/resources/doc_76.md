## FAQs

#### General Questions

Which plan is right for me?

Our Developer plan is a great choice for personal projects. You will have 1 free seat with access to LangSmith (5k base traces/month included).

‍

The Plus plan is for teams that want to self-serve with moderate usage and collaboration needs. You can purchase up to 10 seats with access to LangSmith (10k base traces/month included). You will be able to ship agents with our managed LangSmith Deployment service, with 1 free dev-sized deployment included.

‍

The Enterprise plan is for teams that need more advanced administration, security, support, or deployment options. [Contact our sales team](https://www.langchain.com/contact-sales) to learn more.

Do you offer a plan for startups?

Yes! We offer a Startup Plan for LangSmith, designed for early-stage companies building agentic applications. You’ll get discounted rates and generous free trace allotments to build with confidence from day one.

‍

‍[Apply here](https://airtable.com/app8ZrGLtHAtFVO1o/pagfLAmdTz4ep7TGu/form) to get started with startup pricing. Customers can stay on the Startup Plan for 1 year before graduating to the Plus Plan.

When will I be billed?

For the Developer or Plus Plan, seats are billed monthly on the 1st or pro-rated if added mid-month (no credit for removed seats); traces are billed monthly in arrears for your usage. Enterprise plans are invoiced annually upfront.

Will you train on the data that I send to LangSmith?

We will not train on your data, and you own all rights to your data. See our [Terms of Service](https://www.langchain.com/terms-of-service) for more information.

#### LangSmith Observability & Evaluation Questions

What is a trace? Can it contain multiple events?

A trace represents a single execution of your application—whether it’s an agent, evaluator, or playground session. It can include many individual steps, such as LLM calls and other tracked events. Here's an [example](https://smith.langchain.com/public/17c24270-9f74-47e7-b70c-d508afc448fa/r?_gl=1*h5vp1f*_gcl_au*MTU4Njc4OTgwMy4xNzQ3NzYyMjgx*_ga*MTA0MzgxMzQ2OS4xNzM3MDUyNDkw*_ga_47WX3HKKY2*czE3NDkxNTQ1NDEkbzEzNyRnMSR0MTc0OTE1Njk5MSRqMjQkbDAkaDA.) of a single trace.

What is the difference between a base trace and an extended trace?

Base traces have a shorter retention period of 14 days and cost $0.50 per 1k traces. Extended traces have a longer retention period of 400 days and cost $5.00 per 1k traces. You can "upgrade" base traces to extended traces at $4.50 per 1k traces.

Why might I want to upgrade a base trace to an extended trace?

Base traces are short-lived (14-day retention) and ideal for quick debugging or ad-hoc analysis. They’re priced for volume and short-term utility.

‍

Extended traces, on the other hand, are retained for 400 days and often include valuable feedback—whether from users, evaluators, or human labelers. This feedback makes them essential for ongoing improvement and model tuning (higher utility), which comes with a higher price point.

‍

LangSmith lets you choose the right retention for each trace, helping you balance cost and value.

I’ve exhausted my free trace allocation. What can I do?

If you’ve used up your free traces, you can input your credit card details on the Developer or Plus plans to continue sending traces to LangSmith. If you’ve hit the performance usage limits on your tier, you can upgrade to a higher plan to get better limits, or reach out to support@langchain.dev with questions.

#### LangSmith Deployment Questions

Does LangSmith Deployment include any free deployments?

Plus plans include 1 free dev-sized deployment. If you spin up additional dev-sized or production-sized deployments, you’ll be charged by usage (nodes executed and uptime).

For my free Dev agent deployment for LangSmith Deployment, is there a cap on the number of nodes executed?

If you’re on the Plus plan, you get 1 free dev-sized agentdeployment – all usage in this deployment will be free no matter how many node executions are run.

How do you define nodes executed?

Nodes Executed is the aggregate number of nodes in a LangGraph application that are called and completed successfully during an invocation of the application. If a node in the graph is not called during execution or ends in an error state, these nodes will not be counted. If a node is called and completes successfully multiple times, each occurrence will be counted.

What does uptime mean for LangSmith Deployment usage?

Uptime is the duration your deployment’s database is live and persisting state. Uptime will be tracked as soon as your deployment is live and ends when you shut it down. Dev agent deployments are typically short-lived (used during iteration, then deleted) – whereas Production agent deployments stay live and are updated via revisions (rather than being deleted).

When should I use a dev-sized deployment vs. a production-sized agent deployment?

We recommend using the production-sized deployment for any customer-facing agent. Dev-sized agent deployments are intended for testing and do not support horizontal scaling, backups, or performance optimizations needed in production.
