# Contributing

**Welcome! Thank you for your interest in contributing.** LangChain has helped form the largest developer community in generative AI, and we’re always open to new contributors.

## [​](#ways-to-contribute) Ways to Contribute

Report bugs

Found a bug? Please help us fix it by following these steps:

1

Search

Check if the issue already exists in our GitHub Issues for the respective repo:

[## LangChain

Issues](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues)[## LangGraph

Issues](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/issues)

2

Create issue

If no issue exists, create a new one. When writing, be sure to follow the template provided and to include a [minimal, reproducible, example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). Attach any relevant labels to the final issue once created. If a project maintainer is unable to reproduce the issue, it is unlikely to be addressed in a timely manner.

3

Wait

A project maintainer will triage the issue and may ask for additional information. Please be patient as we manage a high volume of issues. Do not bump the issue unless you have new information to provide.

If you are adding an issue, please try to keep it focused on a single topic. If two issues are related, or blocking, please [link them](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) rather than combining them. For example,

Copy

Ask AI

```
This issue is blocked by #123 and related to #456.This issue is blocked by #123 and related to #456. 
```

Suggest features

Have an idea for a new feature or enhancement?

1

Search

Search the issues for the respective repository for existing feature requests:

[## LangChain

Issues](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22feature%20request%22)[## LangGraph

Issues](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3Aenhancement)

2

Discuss

If no requests exist, start a new discussion under the [relevant category](https://forum.langchain.com/c/help/langchain/14) so that project maintainers and the community can provide feedback.

3

Describe

Be sure to describe the use case and why it would be valuable to others. If possible, provide examples or mockups where applicable. Outline test cases that should pass.

Improve documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome! We strive to keep our docs clear and comprehensive, and your perspective can make a big difference.[## How to propose changes to the documentation

Guide](/oss/python/contributing/documentation)

Contribute code

With a large userbase, it can be hard for our small team to keep up with all the feature requests and bug fixes. If you have the skills and time, we would love your help![## How to make your first Pull Request

Guide](/oss/python/contributing/code)If you start working on an issue, please assign it to yourself or ask a maintainer to do so. This helps avoid duplicate work.If you are looking for something to work on, check out the issues labeled “good first issue” or “help wanted” in our repos:
