## Who we are. What we believe.

What

The world's leading Al-powered developer platform.

Why

Accelerate human progress through developer collaboration.

How

Our values guide our interactions, decision-making, and how we engage with each other.

### GitHub values

We take a customer-centric view, anticipating their needs and striving to exceed them. We listen to feedback from our customers and developers to make sure we help them achieve success and validate our assumptions. Their success is our success.

The journey is as valuable as the destination, and we’re dedicated to shipping often and taking calculated risks. When we’re wrong, we need to pivot quickly, learning from our failures. Each step brings us closer to excellence.

Whatever challenges come our way, we approach with curiosity and use them as opportunities to learn and grow. We’re not limited by our current knowledge, but by how quickly we can grow as a team.

As a team, we take full responsibility and ownership of both our successes and failures. Developers and organizations world-wide depend on us, and we take that responsibility seriously.

Each Hubber brings unique strengths to the team, and we are stronger as a whole for it. We are kind, thoughtful, and considerate as we support and welcome others’ strengths because we know that every successful ship is built by a team.

Representation and diversity matter, and our teams need to be inclusive in order to reflect the global developer community. We are committed to providing a culture where all Hubbers and developers can do their best work.

### Manager fundamentals

GitHub managers are role models and personify our culture and values. They lead with integrity and are accountable to their teams, their peers, our customers, and GitHub as a whole.

GitHub managers help develop their team members by creating an empowering environment that enables others to succeed. They foster innovation and open learning by shipping to learn.

GitHub managers value others and create inclusive environments for people to succeed. They have a genuine interest in the well-being, growth, and success of others.

### Leadership principles

Leaders take the time to see the big picture and create a clear vision on how to proceed. We continuously check that vision and realign as necessary. We know that clarity requires working with others who have different perspectives and can help provide some guidance.

Leaders create a positive environment that is optimistic and motivates others to thrive. We do this by leading by example and creating and growing teams that will be energized to develop skills and work together. By making bold moves and balancing both short and long-term needs, we create an organization that continues to grow.

Leaders focus on what’s possible and encourage innovative ideas that can have meaningful impact. We strive to find the best solutions for the organization and customers, even when it involves taking informed risks. Our tenacity leads to the best outcomes.

### Testimonials

Working at GitHub is the best place to work on open-source software, because open-source is in our DNA. I love to be able to tackle new challenges every day, and see the impact of my work affect millions of customers. There is no more interesting place on the planet to be able to do this kind of work."

Taylor, Engineering

Working here for me isn’t just a job, it’s truly a journey of growth and inspiration. The trust and support I receive from my leadership and colleagues empower me to explore new ideas, challenge the status quo, and truly make a difference in our field."

### Diversity. Inclusion. Belonging.

If we’re going to have a true impact, we need our teams and community to represent the world we live in. To meet this goal, GitHub prioritizes diversity, inclusion, and belonging across our platform, people, philanthropy, and policy.
