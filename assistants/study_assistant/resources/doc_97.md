Why use LangChain?
------------------

[](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain#why-use-langchain)

LangChain helps developers build applications powered by LLMs through a standard interface for models, embeddings, vector stores, and more.

Use LangChain for:

*   **Real-time data augmentation**. Easily connect LLMs to diverse data sources and external/internal systems, drawing from LangChain's vast library of integrations with model providers, tools, vector stores, retrievers, and more.
*   **Model interoperability**. Swap models in and out as your engineering team experiments to find the best choice for your application's needs. As the industry frontier evolves, adapt quickly – LangChain's abstractions keep you moving without losing momentum.
*   **Rapid prototyping**. Quickly build and iterate on LLM applications with LangChain's modular, component-based architecture. Test different approaches and workflows without rebuilding from scratch, accelerating your development cycle.
*   **Production-ready features**. Deploy reliable applications with built-in support for monitoring, evaluation, and debugging through integrations like LangSmith. Scale with confidence using battle-tested patterns and best practices.
*   **Vibrant community and ecosystem**. Leverage a rich ecosystem of integrations, templates, and community-contributed components. Benefit from continuous improvements and stay up-to-date with the latest AI developments through an active open-source community.
*   **Flexible abstraction layers**. Work at the level of abstraction that suits your needs - from high-level chains for quick starts to low-level components for fine-grained control. LangChain grows with your application's complexity.

LangChain ecosystem
-------------------

[](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain#langchain-ecosystem)

While the LangChain framework can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools when building LLM applications.

To improve your LLM application development, pair LangChain with:

*   [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/overview) – Build agents that can reliably handle complex tasks with LangGraph, our low-level agent orchestration framework. LangGraph offers customizable architecture, long-term memory, and human-in-the-loop workflows – and is trusted in production by companies like LinkedIn, Uber, Klarna, and GitLab.
*   [Integrations](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview) – List of LangChain integrations, including chat & embedding models, tools & toolkits, and more
*   [LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith) – Helpful for agent evals and observability. Debug poor-performing LLM app runs, evaluate agent trajectories, gain visibility in production, and improve performance over time.
*   [LangSmith Deployment](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/deployments) – Deploy and scale agents effortlessly with a purpose-built deployment platform for long-running, stateful workflows. Discover, reuse, configure, and share agents across teams – and iterate quickly with visual prototyping in [LangSmith Studio](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/studio).
*   [Deep Agents](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents)_(new!)_ – Build agents that can plan, use subagents, and leverage file systems for complex tasks
