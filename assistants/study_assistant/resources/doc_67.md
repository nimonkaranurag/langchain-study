#### LangChain products power top engineering teams, from AI startups to global enterprises

#### Visibility & control

See exactly what's happening at every step of your agent. Steer your agent to accomplish critical tasks the way you intended.

#### Fast iteration

Rapidly move through build, test, deploy, learn, repeat with workflows across the entire agent engineering lifecycle.

#### Durable performance

Ship at scale with agent infrastructure designed for long-running workloads and human oversight.

#### Model neutral

Swap models, tools, and databases without rewriting your app. Future-proof your stack as AI advances with no vendor lock-in.

#### Your agent engineering stack

Open Source Frameworks

LangChain

LangChain helps you ship quickly with less code using a pre-built agent architecture and model integrations.

LangGraph

LangGraph puts you in control with low-level primitives to build custom agent workflows.

## See exactly what your agent is doing

Agents create dense outputs that make debugging hard. Tracing gives you clear visibility into each step, so you can quickly identify issues and confidently explain what your agent is actually doing.

## Improve agent quality with evals

LLMs are non-deterministic and output natural language, making responses hard to evaluate for accuracy and quality. Build realistic test sets from production data, score performance with evaluators and expert feedback, and iterate to get your agent from 'okay' to 'great'.

## Deploy with infrastructure built for agents

Standard infrastructure can’t handle long-running agent workloads that need human collaboration. Deploy in one click with APIs that handle memory, auto-scaling, and enterprise-grade security out of the box — built for agent workflows that run for hours or days.

[LangSmith Deployment](/langsmith/deployment)

### Build agents your way, with templates or custom control

## Bring your own framework

LangSmith is framework-agnostic. Trace using the TypeScript or Python SDK to gain visibility into your agent interactions, whether you use LangChain's frameworks or not.
