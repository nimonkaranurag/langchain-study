Controllable cognitive architecture for any task
------------------------------------------------

LangGraph's flexible framework supports diverse control flows – single agent, multi-agent, hierarchical, sequential – and robustly handles realistic, complex scenarios. 

Ensure reliability with easy-to-add moderation and quality loops that prevent agents from veering off course.

Use LangGraph Platform to templatize your cognitive architecture so that tools, prompts, and models are easily configurable with LangGraph Platform Assistants.

Designed for human-agent collaboration
--------------------------------------

With built-in statefulness, LangGraph agents seamlessly collaborate with humans by writing drafts for review and awaiting approval before acting. Easily inspect the agent’s actions and "time-travel" to roll back and take a different action to correct course.

Deploy agents at scale, monitor carefully, iterate boldly
---------------------------------------------------------

Design agent-driven user experiences with LangGraph Platform's APIs. Quickly deploy and scale your application with infrastructure built for agents. Choose from multiple deployment options.

### Fault-tolerant scalability

Handle large workloads gracefully with horizontally-scaling servers, task queues, and built-in persistence. Enhance resilience with intelligent caching and automated retries.

### Dynamic APIs for designing agent experience

Craft personalized user experiences with APIs featuring long-term memory to recall information across conversation sessions. Track, update, and rewind your app's state for easy human steering and interaction. Kick off long-running background jobs for research-style or multi-step work.

### Integrated developer experience

Simplify prototyping, debugging, and sharing of agents in our visual LangGraph Studio. Deploy your application with 1-click deploy with our SaaS offering or within your own VPC. Then, monitor app performance with LangSmith.

### Developers trust LangGraph to build reliable agents

LangGraph helps teams of all sizes, across all industries, build reliable agents ready for production.

LangGraph FAQs
--------------

How is LangGraph different from other agent frameworks?

Other agentic frameworks can work for simple, generic tasks but fall short for complex tasks bespoke to a company’s needs. LangGraph provides a more expressive framework to handle companies’ unique tasks without restricting users to a single black-box cognitive architecture.

Does LangGraph impact the performance of my app?

LangGraph will not add any overhead to your code and is specifically designed with streaming workflows in mind.

Is LangGraph open source? Is it free?

Yes. LangGraph is an MIT-licensed open-source library and is free to use.

What are my options if I want to deploy my agent?

You can deploy your LangGraph application using [LangSmith Deployment](http://langchain.com/langsmith/deployment), available in the LangSmith Plus and Enterprise plans. which has the following agent deployment options:

**Cloud:**Fully managed and hosted as part of LangSmith (our unified observability& evals platform).Deploy quickly, with automatic updates and zero maintenance.

‍

**Hybrid** (SaaS control plane, self-hosted data plane). No data leaves your VPC. Provisioning and scaling is managed as a service.

‍

**Fully****Self-Hosted:**Deploy LangGraph entirely on your own infrastructure.
