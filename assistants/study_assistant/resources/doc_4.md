# Learn

Tutorials, conceptual guides, and resources to help you get started.

In the **Learn** section of the documentation, you’ll find a collection of tutorials, conceptual overviews, and additional resources to help you build powerful applications with LangChain and LangGraph.

## [​](#use-cases) Use Cases

Below are tutorials for common use cases, organized by framework.

### [​](#langchain) LangChain

[LangChain](/oss/python/langchain/overview) [agent](/oss/python/langchain/agents) implementations make it easy to get started for most use cases. [## Semantic Search

Build a semantic search engine over a PDF with LangChain components.](/oss/python/langchain/knowledge-base) [## RAG Agent

Create a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) agent.](/oss/python/langchain/rag) [## SQL Agent

Build a SQL agent to interact with databases with human-in-the-loop review.](/oss/python/langchain/sql-agent) [## Supervisor Agent

Build a personal assistant that delegates to sub-agents.](/oss/python/langchain/supervisor)

### [​](#langgraph) LangGraph

LangChain’s [agent](/oss/python/langchain/agents) implementations use [LangGraph](/oss/python/langgraph/overview) primitives. If deeper customization is required, agents can be implemented directly in LangGraph. [## Custom RAG Agent

Build a RAG agent using LangGraph primitives for fine-grained control.](/oss/python/langgraph/agentic-rag) [## Custom SQL Agent

Implement a SQL agent directly in LangGraph for maximum flexibility.](/oss/python/langgraph/sql-agent)

## [​](#conceptual-overviews) Conceptual Overviews

These guides explain the core concepts and APIs underlying LangChain and LangGraph. [## Memory

Understand persistence of interactions within and across threads.](/oss/python/concepts/memory) [## Context engineering

Learn methods for providing AI applications the right information and tools to accomplish a task.](/oss/python/concepts/context) [## Graph API

Explore LangGraph’s declarative graph-building API.](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api) [## Functional API

Build agents as a single function.](/oss/python/langgraph/functional-api)

## [​](#additional-resources) Additional Resources

[## LangChain Academy

Courses and exercises to level up your LangChain skills.](https://academy.langchain.com/) [## Case Studies

See how teams are using LangChain and LangGraph in production.](/oss/python/langgraph/case-studies)
