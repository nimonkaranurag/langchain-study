LangSmith (our platform for agent engineering) is now available through the AWS marketplace. LangSmith helps you trace requests, evaluate outputs, test prompts, and manage deployments in one place. LangSmith is framework agnostic, so you can use it with or without LangChain’s open-source libraries langchain and langgraph. You can use other integrations with AWS like as Amazon Bedrock, Sagemaker, S3, Opensearch, Neptune, Athena, Glue, too. LangSmith is also AWS ISV Accelerate eligible and Deployed on AWS, making it easier for customers and AWS account teams to collaborate.
