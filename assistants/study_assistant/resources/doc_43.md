# Documentation

LangChain is the platform for agent engineering. AI teams at Replit, Clay, Rippling, Cloudflare, Workday, and more trust LangChain’s products to engineer reliable agents.

## Open source agent frameworks

* Python
* TypeScript

[## LangChain (Python)

Quickly get started building agents, with any model provider of your choice.](/oss/python/langchain/overview)[## LangGraph (Python)

Control every step of your custom agent with low-level orchestration, memory, and human-in-the-loop support.](/oss/python/langgraph/overview)[## Deep Agents (Python)

Build agents that can tackle complex, multi-step tasks.](/oss/python/deepagents/overview)

## LangSmith

[**LangSmith**](/langsmith/home) is a platform that helps AI teams use live production data for continuous testing and improvement. LangSmith provides:

[## Observability

See exactly how your agent thinks and acts with detailed tracing and aggregate trend metrics.](/langsmith/observability)[## Evaluation

Test and score agent behavior on production data or offline datasets to continuously improve performance.](/langsmith/evaluation)[## Prompt Engineering

Iterate on prompts with version control, prompt optimization, and collaboration features.](/langsmith/prompt-engineering)[## Deployment

Ship your agent in one click, using scalable infrastructure built for long-running tasks.](/langsmith/deployments)

LangSmith meets the highest standards of data security and privacy with HIPAA, SOC 2 Type 2, and GDPR compliance. For more information, see the [Trust Center](https://trust.langchain.com/).
