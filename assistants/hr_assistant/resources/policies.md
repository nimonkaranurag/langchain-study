## HR POLICIES

### BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS

NIMO INC is committed to principles of business ethics and lawful conduct. It is NIMO INC's policy to conduct itself ethically and lawfully in all matters and to maintain NIMO INC's high standards of business integrity.

Employees must at all times comply with NIMO INC's business conduct and related guidelines. Violation of any NIMO INC guideline is cause for discipline, including dismissal from the company. Employees should consult their management immediately if they have any question whether their actions could violate an NIMO INC guideline.

Furthermore, it is NIMO INC's practice to voluntarily and promptly disclose known violations of government procurement laws to appropriate officials of government. In the event that NIMO INC benefited economically from such known violations, it is our practice to reimburse the government customer accordingly. NIMO INC employees should immediately make known to appropriate levels of management, either directly or through the Open Door or Speak-Up programs, any and all allegations of violations in connection with any government contract.

The Senior Vice President and General Counsel is responsible for providing specific instructions regarding business conduct and ethics and, as appropriate, directing periodic reviews, including business conduct guideline certification programs, to ensure compliance. Each Operating Unit or Subsidiary is responsible for implementing such instructions, including administering certification programs.

### CLIENT EXPERIENCE AND QUALITY

NIMO INC is committed to the goal of achieving the highest standards of quality. Quality forms the basis of our value proposition, our brand image and is the cornerstone upon which NIMO INC builds lasting relationships where we are essential to our clients’ success.

The client’s perception of NIMO INC and its offerings, products and services is the lens through which quality will be evaluated in the marketplace. Our goal is to deliver value to our clients each time they interact with NIMO INC directly or through our business partners in all the geographic markets we serve. NIMO INC listens to client feedback and uses the insights to improve client experience and quality. The client’s decision to choose and recommend NIMO INC to their business partners, colleagues and friends will be part of how NIMO INC will measure success.

NIMO INC leaders are responsible for understanding how clients interact with NIMO INC, for defining measurements and improvement targets and for driving actions to achieve quality goals. All NIMO INCers are expected to model NIMO INC's growth behaviors.

### DATA PRIVACY

As a globally integrated enterprise, NIMO INC's business processes frequently extend beyond the borders of one country. Such globalization demands not only the availability of communication and information systems across the NIMO INC group of companies (NIMO INC), but also the world–wide processing and use of multiple types of information, including Personal Information.

NIMO INC is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of Personal Information about its Employees, Customers, Business Partners (including contacts within Customers and Business Partners) and other identifiable individuals. Uniform practices for collecting, using, disclosing, storing, accessing, transferring or otherwise processing such information assist NIMO INC to process Personal Information fairly and appropriately, disclosing it and/or transferring it only under appropriate circumstances.

This Policy Letter sets forth the general principles that underlie NIMO INC's specific practices for collecting, using, disclosing, storing, accessing, transferring or otherwise processing Personal Information, including the general principle of Privacy by Design. These general principles apply to the processing of Personal Information world–wide by NIMO INC.

The general principles are:

Fairness:
NIMO INC will collect and process Personal Information fairly, lawfully, and in a transparent manner.

Purpose Limitation:
NIMO INC will only collect Personal Information that is relevant to and necessary for a particular purpose(s) and will only process Personal Information in a manner that is not incompatible with the purposes for which it is collected.

Data Minimisation:
NIMO INC will only process Personal Information that is adequate, relevant and not excessive for the purpose for which it is processed.

Accuracy:
NIMO INC will keep Personal Information as accurate, complete and up–to–date as is necessary for the purpose for which it is processed.

Retention:
NIMO INC will keep Personal Information in a form that permits identification for no longer than necessary for the purpose for which such Personal Information was collected.

Disclosure:
NIMO INC will only make Personal Information available inside or outside NIMO INC in appropriate circumstances.

Security:
NIMO INC will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard Personal Information and will instruct third parties processing Personal Information on behalf of NIMO INC, if any, to process it only in a manner that is consistent with processing it on NIMO INC's behalf, and to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard the Personal Information.

Individual Rights:
NIMO INC will provide individuals with appropriate rights such as right of access and correction relating to their Personal Information, as set out in the Binding Corporate Rules and in applicable law.

Custodianship:
NIMO INC will have appropriate policies and practices for the safe handling of Personal Information that it processes on behalf of its customers.

Accountability:
NIMO INC will have appropriate governance, including corporate instructions, guidelines, appropriately trained personnel and other measures to be able to demonstrate that the processing of Personal Information is performed in compliance with this Policy Letter.

NIMO INC Employees who come in contact with Personal Information must act consistently with the principles contained in this Policy Letter.

The application of these principles is more particularly described in the applicable NIMO INC Corporate Instructions (and any accompanying implementation guidelines) relating to processing Personal Information.

### ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS

NIMO INC is committed to environmental affairs leadership in all of its business activities. NIMO INC has had long-standing corporate policies of providing a safe and healthful workplace, protecting the environment, and conserving energy and natural resources, which were formalized in 1967, 1971 and 1974, respectively. They have served the environment and our business well over the years and provide the foundation for the following corporate policy objectives:


Provide a safe and healthful workplace and ensure that personnel are properly trained and have appropriate safety and emergency equipment.
Be an environmentally responsible neighbor in the communities where we operate, and act promptly and responsibly to correct incidents or conditions that endanger health, safety or the environment. Report them to authorities promptly and inform affected parties as appropriate.

Conduct rigorous audits and self-assessments of NIMO INC’s compliance with this policy, measure progress of NIMO INC’s environmental affairs performance, and report periodically to the Board of Directors.
Every employee and every contractor on NIMO INC premises is expected to follow this policy and to report any environmental, health or safety concern to NIMO INC management. Managers are expected to take prompt action.

### GLOBAL EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS

At NIMO INC, we have always set high standards for the way we conduct business – in areas from corporate and social responsibility to sound business ethics, including compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

These Conduct Principles apply to all NIMO INC employees. However, they are not meant to describe the full scope of NIMO INC human resource policies or practices. More detailed statements of policies, procedures and practices are contained in documents such as the NIMO INC Business Conduct Guidelines. Employees are required to comply with all NIMO INC policies, procedures and practices at all times and are responsible for consulting their management if they have any questions.

Our goal is to ensure full compliance with these principles by NIMO INC managers and employees. A companion to this document, the NIMO INC Supplier Conduct Principles, governs our relationships with and standards for NIMO INC suppliers.

Freely Chosen Employment
Forced, bonded (including debt bondage) or indentured labor; involuntary prison labor; slavery or trafficking of persons shall not be used. This includes transporting, harboring, recruiting, transferring, or receiving persons by means of threat, force, coercion, abduction or fraud for labor or services. There shall be no unreasonable restrictions on workers’ freedom of movement in the facility in addition to unreasonable restrictions on entering or exiting company-provided facilities. As part of the hiring process, workers must be provided with a written employment agreement in their native language (or in a language the worker can understand unless otherwise required by law) that contains a description of terms and conditions of employment prior to the worker departing from his or her country of origin. Employment is voluntary and employees shall be free to terminate their employment at any time. Employers and agents may not hold or otherwise destroy, conceal, confiscate, or deny access by employees to employees’ identity or immigration documents, such as government-issued identification, passports, or work permits, unless such holdings are required by law. Workers shall not be required to pay employers’ or agents’ recruitment fees or other related fees for their employment. If any such fees are found to have been paid by workers, such fees shall be repaid to the worker.

Young Workers
NIMO INC will comply with all applicable child labor laws. We support the use of legitimate workplace learning, internship, and other similar programs which comply with all laws and regulations applicable to such programs. Employees under the age of 18 (Young Workers) shall not perform work that is likely to jeopardize their health or safety including night shift and overtime. NIMO INC shall ensure proper management of student workers through proper maintenance of student records, rigorous due diligence of educational partners, and protection of students’ rights in accordance with applicable law and regulations, and will provide appropriate support and training to all student workers. In the absence of local law, the wage rate for student workers, interns, and apprentices shall be at least the same wage rate as other entry level workers performing equal or similar tasks. In the unlikely event an instance of child labor is discovered, the matter will be referred to the VP, Global Recruitment and the VP, Employee and Labor Relations for immediate corrective action.

Wages and Benefits
NIMO INC will, at a minimum, comply with all applicable wage and hour laws and regulations, including those relating to minimum wages, overtime hours, piece rates, non-exempt or exemption classification and other elements of compensation, and provide legally mandated benefits. The pay which employees receive will be reflected in a timely and understandable manner via a pay statement or similar documentation that includes sufficient information to verify accurate compensation for work performed, including overtime compensation and its calculation if appropriate. All use of temporary, dispatch and outsourced labor will be within the limits of the local law.

Working hours
NIMO INC will not exceed maximum hours of work prescribed by law and will appropriately compensate overtime. Employees will not be required to work more than 60 hours per week, including overtime, except in extraordinary business circumstances with their consent or where the nature of the position requires such work, such as for exempt employees and employees in executive, managerial or professional positions. In countries where the maximum work week is shorter, that standard shall apply. Employees shall be allowed at least one day off during every seven day work week.

Non-discrimination and Harassment
NIMO INC will not discriminate in hiring, promotion, training, compensation of employees and employment practices on grounds of race, color, religion, age, national origin, social or ethnic origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, marital status, pregnancy, political affiliation, union membership, protected genetic information, disability, covered veteran status or any other characteristics protected by applicable law. NIMO INC will create a work environment free of discrimination or harassment based on the noted categories. Workers shall be provided with reasonable accommodation for religious practices. In addition, workers or potential workers should not be subjected to medical tests or physical exams that could be used in a discriminatory way.

Respect and Dignity
NIMO INC will treat all employees with respect and dignity and will not use corporal punishment, threats of violence, or other forms of abuse, physical coercion or harassment. Disciplinary policies and practices in support of these requirements shall be clearly defined and communicated to workers.

Freedom of Association
In conformance with local law, NIMO INC will respect the legal rights of all its employees to form and join worker organizations of their own choosing, including labor organizations or trade unions, or to refrain from forming and joining such organizations, for purposes of bargaining collectively and to engage in peaceful assembly. NIMO INC complies with applicable local laws worldwide regarding employee and third-party involvement, and will not discriminate based on an employee’s decision to join or not join a labor organization. NIMO INC respects the rights of employees to organize, and makes managers at all levels aware of those rights. Employees and/or their representatives shall be able to openly communicate and share ideas and concerns with management regarding working conditions and management practices without fear of discrimination, reprisal, intimidation, or harassment. The Company’s long-standing belief is that the interests of NIMO INC and its employees are best served through a favorable, collaborative work environment with direct communication between employees and management. NIMO INC endeavors to establish such favorable employment conditions, to promote positive relationships between employees and managers, to facilitate employee communications, and to support employee development.

Health and Safety
NIMO INC will provide its employees with a safe and healthy workplace in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Consistent with these obligations, NIMO INC will have and implement effective programs that encompass things such as life safety, incident investigation, chemical safety, ergonomics, and provide safe standards of health and safety in any housing and transportation provided for our employees by the company. Workers will be provided health and safety training in their primary language. Health and Safety related information shall be clearly posted in the facility.

At a minimum, NIMO INC will comply with all applicable environmental laws, regulations and standards, such as requirements regarding chemical and waste management and disposal, recycling, industrial wastewater treatment and discharge, air emissions controls, environmental permits and environmental reporting. NIMO INC will also comply with any additional environmental requirements specific to the products or services being provided to NIMO INC as called for in design and product specifications, and contract documents.

Laws, including regulations and other legal requirements
NIMO INC will comply with all applicable laws, regulations and other legal requirements in all locations where it conducts business.

Ethical Dealings
NIMO INC expects its employees to conduct business in accordance with the highest ethical standards, and maintains Business Conduct Guidelines that employees are required to follow. NIMO INC strictly complies with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and all laws and regulations on bribery, corruption and prohibited business practices. NIMO INC does not offer employment or any other form of work experience (paid or unpaid) in exchange for obtaining business or other advantages for NIMO INC. NIMO INC Global Procurement maintains NIMO INC’s policy regarding conflict minerals.

Communications
NIMO INC makes available to all employees open communications channels for suggestions and complaints to management. NIMO INC maintains channels for direct contact with the Corporate Office for employee complaints, including any form of harassment including sexual harassment.

Monitoring/Record Keeping
NIMO INC will perform business audits to ensure adherence to our policies, practices and procedures. We will keep records in accordance with local laws and regulations.

Privacy
NIMO INC is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of information about its employees. NIMO INC recognizes that under the laws of some countries certain information about employees, such as information regarding racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, and health or sex life, should be considered “sensitive.” Whenever possible, such sensitive information should be processed in aggregate or anonymous form so that a particular individual is not identifiable. Where this is not feasible, NIMO INC will only process the information in accordance with applicable local law (and any designated safeguards provided therein); and with employee consent where required; or where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. All employees are expected to use information about NIMO INC clients, suppliers, and business partners in accordance with their job responsibilities and the NIMO INC Business Conduct Guidelines.

Support for employees and community involvement
NIMO INC provides numerous programs for employees to encourage and enhance the positive impact of their community involvement. These global programs include: On Demand Community, a suite of online tools and resources to support employee volunteerism; Community Grants, a program that awards long-term volunteer commitments with grants of cash or NIMO INC equipment; and Matching Grants, a program through which NIMO INC matches employee grants to schools and nonprofit organizations.

Management System
Formal corporate policies issued by the NIMO INC Chief Executive Officer, or the senior officer he or she directs, govern company-wide actions within NIMO INC and actions with all third parties. Our corporate policies reflect NIMO INC’s values and the resulting management system within which our decisions are made.

Applicability:
This instruction applies to all NIMO INC corporate functions, business units, and wholly owned subsidiaries, and majority owned subsidiaries which are subject to the NIMO INC Business Conduct Guidelines.

### HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES

NIMO INC is committed to high standards of corporate responsibility. Our definition of corporate responsibility includes environmental responsibility, as well as social concerns for our workforce, clients, business partners, and the communities where we operate.

Underpinning our corporate responsibility standards and practices is our dedication to respect human rights. NIMO INC’s stance on human rights is informed by international standards, including the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

NIMO INC has a strong culture of ethics and integrity, guided by a rigorous system of corporate governance that promotes transparency on a global basis and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations where we do business.

Approach and Impact
Throughout its history, NIMO INC has taken a thoughtful, comprehensive approach to corporate responsibility that is based on NIMO INC’s values and takes into account four areas of impact that are of particular interest to our stakeholders, i.e. support of our employees and communities; the impact of NIMO INC’s products and operations on the environment; the management of our global supply chain: and, the governance, ethics, and integrity of our company.

NIMO INC’s approach recognizes our vast network of stakeholders and the understanding that our work can impact not only our business success, but also the efficiency and innovation of countries, cities, governments, communities, and our planet’s critical infrastructure.

We strive to maximize NIMO INC’s positive impact as a global enterprise in a number of ways: we identify and act upon new opportunities to apply our technology and expertise to societal problems; we scale our existing corporate responsibility programs and initiatives to help achieve maximum benefit; we empower our employees and others to serve their communities: and, we integrate corporate citizenship and our respect for human rights throughout our company.

We focus our engagement and programs on specific societal issues, including community economic development, education, health, literacy, language and culture. These are areas of basic human and wider societal needs where we can apply NIMO INC’s technology and talent to help solve problems and to contribute to the advancement of human rights.

Our Ethical Guidelines
NIMO INC’s Business Conduct Guidelines (BCGs) serve as our global code of conduct for NIMO INC employees, and reflect our longstanding commitment to high ethical conduct and decision-making. They specify NIMO INC’s standards of business ethics, basic values and principles.

The BCGs are complemented by formal corporate directives that govern our companywide actions. Their intent is to express clear direction on the things that are fundamental and therefore most enduring in our business. In addition to guiding action in specific areas such as environmental affairs or data privacy, our corporate policies also include a set of Global Employment Standards.

NIMO INC Global Employment Standards
These principles apply to NIMO INC employees and are explained more fully on our "Responsibility at NIMO INC" webpage. We expect our managers and employees to comply fully with these Standards.

The Global Employment Standards address areas that are important to human rights and include among others the commitment that NIMO INC:

will not use forced or child labor will comply at a minimum with all applicable wage and hour laws and regulations will comply with legal limits to working time will create a work environment free of discrimination or harassment and will treat all employees with respect and dignity will respect the legal rights of its employees to join (or not) worker organizations, including labor organizations or trade unions NIMO INC strives to establish favorable employment conditions, to promote positive relationships between employees and managers, to facilitate employee communications, and to support employee development.

We train our employees and we perform regular business reviews to confirm compliance to our policies, practices and procedures. For example, periodically, usually each year, NIMO INC employees are required to formally certify to the BCG and complete online, interactive training.

Working with partners and suppliers
Working with third parties is an integral part of NIMO INC’s business in meeting the needs of our clients. NIMO INC’s Business Partner Code of Conduct describes the minimum standards of business conduct and practices we expect from our business partners, for example, that employees are provided with a work environment free of coercion, discrimination, and harassment. If applicable laws and regulations are more permissive than this Code of Conduct, business partners are expected to comply with the NIMO INC Code of Conduct. As appropriate, NIMO INC provides business partners with online, and in some instances live, training on ethics and integrity.

For our supply chain relationships, NIMO INC uses the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct (formerly the EICC Code of Conduct) as a single code for our global supply base. The RBA Code of Conduct establishes the standards we expect from our suppliers in doing business with NIMO INC across several areas of social responsibility, including labor, health, safety, protection of the environment, ethics, and management systems. Our goal is to work with our suppliers to foster their full compliance to the RBA Code of Conduct and we expect them to cascade these standards to their extended sources of supply engaged in the production of goods and services for NIMO INC. We consider these standards in our supplier selection process and monitor ongoing performance, as needed, by periodic third party supplier compliance audits. NIMO INC reserves the right to take action with suppliers that do not comply with the RBA Code of Conduct and may consider measures such as reducing or ending business in accordance with contract terms.

Communication and Concerns & Appeals Mechanisms and Channels
NIMO INC makes available to all employees open communications channels for suggestions and complaints to management; NIMO INC also maintains a channel for contact with the management for employee complaints, a channel to discuss concerns with specialists for guidance, and a channel to raise concerns anonymously. These may address complaints of any kind, including any form of harassment and misconducts of sexual nature. NIMO INC does not tolerate threats or acts of retaliation against any employee for reporting a concern or suspected violation. Additional communication channels are available for suppliers, business partners, and others to report concerns or suspected violations to the company, including ways for submitting anonymous reports.

Governance
NIMO INC senior management is ultimately responsible for our economic, environmental, and social corporate responsibility programs and progress, including our dedication to human rights, as well as our adherence to NIMO INC’s overall compliance programs. The NIMO INC Board and our CEO annually review NIMO INC’s corporate responsibility programs and progress. Our dedication to corporate responsibility is fostered throughout the company and integrated across the business through the following forums.

Corporate Responsibility Executive Steering Committee and Working Group
Our Corporate Responsibility Executive Steering Committee comprises senior executives from functional areas across the business and is chaired by NIMO INC’s Vice President for Corporate Citizenship and Corporate Affairs. The committee meets periodically to provide leadership and direction on key human rights and corporate responsibility issues. Each functional area is responsible for the development of its own goals and strategy, with organization-wide goals approved by the steering committee.

Our Corporate Responsibility Working Group consists of representatives from functional areas (including global representation) and meets regularly to manage NIMO INC’s human rights and corporate responsibility activities and stakeholder engagement. The working group reviews key standards and strategic issues in the area of corporate responsibility and human rights and makes recommendations to the steering committee throughout the year.

Stakeholder engagement and reporting
NIMO INC actively works with stakeholders who examine and influence our human rights and corporate responsibility programs and practices. We view stakeholder engagement as much more than communications and consultation. For us, it is about business engagement and collaboration—working shoulder-to-shoulder with communities, governments, investors, and the social sector. We work closely together with organizations that are taking similarly innovative, global, open, and collaborative approaches to corporate citizenship and sustainability.

We publicly report on our corporate responsibility initiatives and progress through our annual corporate responsibility report, additional GRI reports, and specific ad-hoc publications on particular areas such as diversity and equal opportunity.

### INCLUSION @NIMO INC

The employees of NIMO INC represent a talented and diverse workforce of individuals from all backgrounds and experiences. Achieving the full potential of all NIMO INCers is a business priority that is fundamental to innovation and creativity, which ensure our competitive success. NIMO INC's long-standing commitment to equal opportunity is based on sound business judgment and anchored in NIMO INC values.

NIMO INC has more than 100 years of work on diversity, inclusion and equality in the workplace. That legacy, and our continued commitment to advance equity in a global society, has made us leaders in diversity and inclusion. Guided by our values and beliefs, we're proud to foster an environment where every NIMO INCer is able to thrive because of their differences, not in spite of them. 

Dating back to 1953 when Thomas J. Watson, Jr. issued Policy Letter #4, NIMO INC has committed to hire “people who have the personality, talent and background necessary to fill a given job, regardless of race, color or creed.”  This is interpreted in a modern environment, and to adhere to various local laws, as the policy of this organization to continue to engage in activities such as hiring, promotion and compensation of employees, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, caste, genetics, pregnancy, mental or physical disability, neurodivergence, age or other characteristics protected by applicable law. NIMO INC makes reasonable accommodations available where the Company believes they are appropriate to enable employees with disabilities and others to effectively perform their jobs.

In respecting and valuing the diversity among our employees and all those with whom we do business, managers and employees are expected to foster an inclusive work environment free of all forms of discrimination, harassment, bullying and retaliation. Every manager in NIMO INC is expected to abide by this policy, and all applicable laws on this subject, and to uphold NIMO INC's commitment to inclusion. 

April 2025

### INCLUSIVE BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS

Wherever NIMO INC operates around the world, we strive to conduct our business in a fair and equitable manner. Consistent with this objective, we follow local laws and customs of the countries in which we operate, and we actively seek to establish close working relationships with businesses indigenous to those countries. 

The policy of the NIMO INC Corporation is to provide all businesses with equal opportunity to participate in all areas of NIMO INC's marketing, procurement, and contracting activities. This policy applies to all firms or institutions regardless of the business owner's race, color, religion, gender, pregnancy, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, caste, disability, age, or status as a special disabled veteran or other veteran. 

In the United States, these activities comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, including those dealing with the use of small business; small, disadvantaged business; women-owned small businesses; HUBZone businesses; veteran-owned businesses and service-disabled veterans. 

This policy applies to all areas of expenditures, whether for products or services. Action should be taken by all NIMO INC organizations to ensure that this policy is implemented and that there are programs which ensure NIMO INC's performance against this commitment. 

May 2025

### POLITICS

It is NIMO INC’s long–standing policy that we participate in politics as private citizens, not as NIMO INCers. Therefore, it is the policy of the NIMO INC Company not to make contributions of resources such as money, goods or services to political candidates or parties. This policy applies equally in all countries where NIMO INC does business, regardless of whether or not such contributions are considered legal in any host country.

We encourage NIMO INC employees to participate in political activity in their individual communities and countries. The Company will do everything reasonable to accommodate employees who need to be away from work while running for or holding political office, or fulfilling significant party duties during a campaign or election. NIMO INC will not pay employees for time off for political activity. However, if a country where NIMO INC does business has a law which requires an employer to give time off, with pay, to any employee holding public office, then that law takes precedence.

Because NIMO INC does business with many levels of government, we have instituted procedures designed to avoid conflict of interest situations for NIMO INC employees holding government offices. These procedures must be followed.

### TRUST AND TRANSPARENCY

For more than a century, NIMO INC has earned the trust of our clients by responsibly managing their most valuable data. And we have worked to earn the trust of society by ushering powerful new technologies into the world responsibly and with clear purpose.
NIMO INC continues to follow core principles, grounded in commitments to trust and transparency, that guide its handling of client data and insights. These principles also guide its responsible development and deployment of new technologies, such as NIMO INC Watson® to the more advanced watsonx™. 

We encourage all technology companies to adopt similar principles to protect client data and insights, and to ensure the responsible and transparent use of artificial intelligence (AI) and other transformative innovations. We offer our own Trust and Transparency Principles here as a roadmap. They include:

The purpose of AI is to augment human intelligence
At NIMO INC, we believe AI should make all of us better at our jobs, and that the benefits of the AI era should touch many, not just an elite few.

Data and insights belong to their creators
NIMO INC clients’ data is their data, and their insights are their insights. We believe that government data policies should be fair and equitable, and prioritize openness.

New technology must be transparent and explainable
Technology companies must be clear about who trains their AI systems, what data was used in that training and, most importantly, what went into their algorithm’s recommendations.
AI for human intelligence
An illuminated circuit board with an image of a brain inside a light bulb 
The purpose of AI and cognitive systems developed and applied by NIMO INC is to augment, not replace, human intelligence. Our technology is and will be designed to enhance and extend human capability and potential. NIMO INC is investing in initiatives to help the global workforce gain the skills needed to work in partnership with these technologies.

Investing in skills for the era of man and machine

NIMO INC does not believe that taxing automation or penalizing innovation is an effective substitute for investing in the workforce of the future.

NIMO INC is working with policymakers to modernize education systems to emphasize in-demand skills rather than focusing solely on specific academic degrees.

Better preparing more students and workers for modern careers, including well-paying new collar jobs, will help ensure that more people have an opportunity to benefit from technology-driven economic growth.

NIMO INC encourages governments to:
Better align education with in-demand skills and competencies;
Support business investment in retraining employees; and
Encourage individuals to invest in skills for career advancement.
Data and insights belong to their creators

NIMO INC clients’ data is their data, and their insights are their insights. Client data and the insights produced on NIMO INC Cloud® or from NIMO INC’s AI are owned by NIMO INC’s clients. 

Data and insight ownership
Clients are not required to relinquish rights to their data—nor the insights derived from that data—to have the benefits of NIMO INC’s solutions and services. 

NIMO INC client agreements are transparent. We will not use client data unless they agree to such use and we will limit that use to the specific purposes clearly described in the agreement.
NIMO INC employs industry-leading security practices to safeguard data. This includes use of encryption, access control methodologies and proprietary consent management modules, which allow us to restrict access to authorized users and to de-identify data in accordance with applicable permissions.
 

Data privacy
NIMO INC is fully committed to protecting the privacy of our clients’ data, which is fundamental in a data-driven society.
How we advance data privacy

While there is no single approach to privacy, NIMO INC complies with the data privacy laws in all countries and territories in which we operate.
NIMO INC was an early leader in developing and adopting the European Union (EU) Data Protection Code of Conduct for Cloud Service Providers for several offerings. NIMO INC secured certification under the US-EU Privacy Shield and the APEC Cross-Border Privacy Rules. And it established a comprehensive compliance framework to help ensure general data protection regulation (GDPR) compliance for all NIMO INC products and services.
NIMO INC will advocate for strong and innovative means to enhance privacy and data protection, and will continue to invest in privacy-enhancing technologies.
NIMO INC supports global cooperation to facilitate mutual recognition of privacy regimes to enhance and facilitate cross-border data flows.

Data security
NIMO INC is devoting our powerful engines of innovation to create tools to protect our clients, their data and global trade from cyberthreats. We are also convening a broader discussion on balancing security, privacy and freedom.

NIMO INC client agreements are transparent. We will not use client data unless they agree to such use and we will limit that use to the specific purposes clearly described in the agreement.
NIMO INC employs industry-leading security practices to safeguard data. This includes use of encryption, access control methodologies and proprietary consent management modules, which allow us to restrict access to authorized users and to de-identify data in accordance with applicable permissions.

Government access to data
NIMO INC has not provided client data to any government agency under any surveillance program involving bulk collection of content or metadata.

In general, if a government wants access to data held by NIMO INC on behalf of an enterprise client, we would expect that government to deal directly with that client.
We do not provide access to client data stored outside the lawful jurisdiction of any government requesting such data, unless the request is made through internationally recognized legal channels such as mutual legal assistance treaties (MLATs).
If we receive a request for enterprise client data that does not follow processes in accordance with local law, we will take appropriate steps to challenge the request through judicial action or other means.
If we receive a government request for enterprise client data that includes a gag order prohibiting us from notifying that client, we will take appropriate steps to challenge the gag order through judicial action or other means.
We will continue to work closely with governments and clients to balance the protection of data with law enforcement’s obligation to conduct lawful investigations of criminal activity.
NIMO INC supports measures to increase the transparency, oversight and appropriate judicial review of government requests for data, including modernized international agreements on legal assistance.

Cross-border data flows
NIMO INC views the free movement of data across borders as essential to 21st century commerce.

NIMO INC supports digital trade agreements that enable and facilitate the cross-border flow of data and that limit data localization requirements.
NIMO INC believes that clients, not governments, should determine where their data is stored and how it is processed. Mandating that data be kept or processed within national boundaries does not make it safer from hackers or cybercriminals.
NIMO INC continues to make significant investments in cloud data centers around the world to give clients the flexibility to decide where to store and process their data. These decisions should generally be driven by client choice rather than government mandate.
Transparent and explainable AI
For the public to trust AI, it must be transparent. If we are to use AI to help make important decisions, it must be explainable.

NIMO INC will make clear:

When and for what purposes AI is being applied in the cognitive solutions we develop and deploy.

The major sources of data and expertise that inform the insights of cognitive solutions, and also the methods used to train those systems and solutions.

That while bias can never be fully eliminated, and our work to eliminate it will never be complete, we and all companies advancing AI have an obligation to address it proactively. Therefore, we continually test our systems and find new data sets to better align their output with human values and expectations.

The principle that clients own their own business models and intellectual property and that they can use AI and cognitive systems to enhance the advantages they have built. We will work with our clients to protect their data and insights, and will encourage our clients, partners and industry colleagues to adopt similar practices.

Our firm support for transparency and data governance policies that will ensure people understand how an AI system came to a conclusion or recommendation.

### RECIPROCITY

It is NIMO INC's policy neither to buy nor to sell on a reciprocity basis.

To maintain the high performance standards of our products, we must base all our purchases on quality, price and the supplier's reliability. To use reciprocity as a purchasing consideration would limit our field of supply and could jeopardize our product quality and price.

In addition, we should never use our extensive purchases to aid our selling efforts. We must leave customers free to buy, unhampered by any reciprocity considerations.
